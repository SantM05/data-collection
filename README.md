data-collection
### Data collection is a web scrapping and data analysis project where we make use of splinter and bs4 libraries to automate the browsing and extraction of the the following web pages: 
### 1.https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_news/index.html
### 2. https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_facts/temperature.html
### Given a recent change in the setup on the local pc a continous error happens with the the browser package of the splinter library not identifying the chrome driver. As a result the output of the code files is not avaliable in the commit, though with the correct setup the code runs without issue.
### The use of a soup object was fundamental for the scrapping as well as the use .html parser to create a structured document to navigate and analyse.
